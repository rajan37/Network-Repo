# Commands to run: 
#1) ansible-playbook getarp1.yml -u rajan -k
#2) Grep for MAC address: ansible-playbook getarp1.yml -u rajan -k | grep 'ok:\|fe7a'
#3) Grep for IP address: ansible-playbook getarp1.yml -u rajan -k | grep 'ok:\|122\.3'


'ok:\|122\.3' --> regular exppression 

in this case look for "ok:" or denoted by \(backslash) and the |122\.3 backslash before "." indicates that its not a individual character but its 122.3
